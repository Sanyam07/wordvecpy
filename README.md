# Word Vector Embedding Package

**wordvecpy** is a library for processing text data, tokenizing it, and building word vector dictionaries and whole word vector embeddings from the corpus text.

**TextProcessor** takes a corpus of unprocessed text and processes it for use with word vectors.  Punctuation, stopwords, substitutions, contractions, and lemmatization can all be customized.  TextProcessor can store a processed (or unprocessed) text corpus (with or without it's associated labels) in a specially designed text format that can interact with other classes in the library.  This gives extra functionality when dealing with large text corpii which take up a lot of local memory that is needed for other processes, like building the vector embedded forms of the corpus.  The **LoadCorpus** class allows pulling only selected chunks of the dataset into memory for processing at one time, so large files can be processed in small chunks that fit in your computer's memory.  **Chunkify** works with this and with other datasets completely stored in memory to split a corpus into chunks and generate vector embeddings one chunk at a time (vector embeddings for multiple docs can quickly take up all of a computer's memory if you don't manage the memory well).

**VectorDictionary** loads pretrained word embeddings from .txt files so they can be used with other classes.  Every class in this package that requires a vector dictionary can take a pymagnitude vector or a VectorDictionary object.

**Vectokenizer** and **FastVectokenizer** both convert processed text corpus into integer embeddings and create vector dictionaries for those associated integer embeddings.  Both classes do the exact same thing but FastVectokenizer requires Keras to create integer embeddings and Vectokenizer does not.  Both classes allow you to easily and quickly generate necessary integer embeddings and word vector dictionaries to import directly into a Keras embedding layer.  I've considered removing **Vectokenizer** but I have future plans for it's functionality that cannot be easily done using keras to tokenize the corpus.

**VectorEmbedder** is where the magic happens and a text corpus (or chunk of a text corpus) is embedded with word vectors.  This can be done with both static vector dictionaries like Stanford's various GLoVe embeddings or with dynamic embeddings that are context dependent like Google's ELMO embeddings.

This package was created to give me experience with creating a custom library and distributing it with PyPi, so any feedback (positive or negative) would be greatly appreciated.

## Current Version is 1.0

This was a very early attempt at implementing a Python package and distributing it on PyPi.  It was originally a collection of classes that I was using locally to work a few problems and I decided to publish it to make it easier to import on Google Colab and give myself practice at publishing a working package. The code is messy and I plan on redoing it at some point when I get the time.  I had done significant testing on these classes with a local script but without using the Python unittest modules. During the process of rebuilding the classes, I will be converting the test script into proper unit tests for each class.  Despite this, I *have* done some pretty extensive testing on the package but it is difficult--if not impossible--to test every combination of functionalities.  If you come across a use case where wordvecpy fails, *please please please* let me know.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install wordvecpy.

```bash
pip install wordvecpy
```

## Usage

Some use cases can be found in the various python notebooks in my exploration of the Rotten Tomatoes dataset found here: https://github.com/metriczulu/rotten-tomato-reviews

## Future Plans

Working on functionality to reduce the number of words in sequence by clustering words based on their vector representations.  This will hopefully allow smaller vector dictionaries to be used while maintaining decent functionality.

Also working on functionality to build multi-channel (or concatenated, your choice) embeddings by combining multiple embedding frameworks together.

Currently, it is possible to use word vector embeddings with PyTorch by converting all documents to embeddings with **VectorEmbedder**.  There is a better, more organic way to work with PyTorch than this and I plan on implementing it once I'm satisfied with the overall functionality of the package.  Currently, only Keras (and TF with it) are directly supported as it is the easiest to get working and out the door.

**Vectokenizer** currently has a memory intensive ad-hoc design (which is why **FastVectokenizer** is currently much better).  I will be reworking it so that it is in-line with **FastVectokenizer**'s speed while providing the additional capability of clustering words by vector to reduce dictionary size mentioned above.

I also need to get the comments and documentation up to par to make it easier for others to get it working.

## License

No license but I'm just throwing this out there:  if this library fails miserably and turns your computer into a black hole which swallows your life's work, I'd like to say first and foremost, I'm sorry.  However, use at your own risk.
